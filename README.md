# vrs

Welcome to the source code for VRS's website! Built in Jekyll, LESS, HTML, and JavaScript.

# Running locally

In the folder you wish to be the root of your VRS dev project, run

```git
git clone https://github.com/Virtual-FTC/vrs-site.git .
```

If you have Ruby installed, run `bundle exec jekyll serve` (It will default to port 4000. If 4000 is not availible, you can use the `port` flag to specify a different port.)

If you do not have Ruby installed, follow [these directions](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/)
